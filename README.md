        The project is a complete travel itinerary platform with front-end and back-end components. Its primary goal is to simulate a system for scheduling and managing trips, offering features such as activity tracking and participant management. This project was developed during the NLW Journey, a Rocketseat event, as a way to enhance knowledge of web development using Node.js and TypeScript.
